National Hot Dog and Sausage Council
Announces Official Policy On ‘Hot Dog as
Sandwich’ Controversy

Limiting the hot dog’s significance by saying it’s ‘just a sandwich’ is like
calling the Dalai Lama ‘just a guy’. Perhaps at one time its importance could
be limited by forcing it into a larger sandwich category (no disrespect to
Reubens and others), but that time has passed. We therefore choose to take a
cue from a great performer and declare our namesake be a “hot dog formerly
known as a sandwich. Read full announcement here. (http://www.hot-
