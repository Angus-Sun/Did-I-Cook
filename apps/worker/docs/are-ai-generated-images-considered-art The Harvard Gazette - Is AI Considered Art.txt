The emergence of Al-image generators, such as DALL-E 2, Discord, Midjourney, and
others, has stirred a controversy over whether art generated by artificial intelligence
should be considered real art — and whether it could put artists and creators out of
work. The Gazette spoke with faculty who are involved in the production of art — a
writer, a film animator, an architect, a musician, and a mixed-media artist — to ask them
whether they see Al as a threat or a collaborator or a tool to further their own creativity

and imagination. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity.

“Most at risk are commercial genres with
easily recognizable styles and tropes.’

| recently judged a story contest, and reading the shortlist was a clue to the challenges
Al might encounter in creating good writing versus great. The best of these human-
written stories surprised me with 1) unique ways of viewing the world (personality), 2)
linguistic originality, 3) inimitable details that could come only from personal experience.
Other stories were written deftly yet lacked these elements of originality and surprise.
Al is a superb mimic and quick learner and might easily write strong works in
recognizable modes, and with linguistic experimentation if prompted, but — | think — will
lack true insight and experience. Most at risk are commercial genres with easily
recognizable styles and tropes. Even something like autofiction with its ruminating first-
person narrators is easily mimicked — but what will be missing, I’m guessing, is genuine
vision from living in a specific physical world.

“That sense of interplay, or the ability to react
in the moment, is something that artificial
intelligence can't reproduce.”

When it comes to the performative aspect of music, artificial intelligence is not a
concern to me. Music can transmit and represent emotion, and Al cannot do either of
those things yet. And especially within jazz and creative music, music is in-the-moment
composition, something that happens as musicians are collaborating onstage. That
sense of interplay, or the ability to react in the moment, is something that artificial
intelligence can’t reproduce because to do that requires being intelligent and having the
agency to use your curiosity and your musical vocabulary. Only then, you can be able to
react and create music in the moment.

With regards to composition, we know that Al has been used to compose music for film
and television for quite a few years. That is a concern because Al is doing the work that
musicians used to do. But when you hear those compositions by Al, they lack surprise,
emotion, and even silence. | love dramatism in music, and for me, emotion in music is
important, and Al is not there yet. As for how music gets to people, this is where we
have seen tremendous changes. The many music platforms we have, such as Spotify,
YouTube, iTunes, etc., use algorithm-based features, and they make musical
recommendations based on what you listen to. We all know that Al is behind it.
Musicians would like to see algorithms suggest composers who are less known rather
than those who are already popular. The new technology should democratize the field,
make sure that people have access to things that are outside the mainstream, and learn
to recognize musical traditions that are not only from the Western world.

It’s important to welcome Al with open arms to try to understand what Al can do for us
and work with it in creative ways. Any new technology is first seen as a threat to the
status quo, like the way radio was received when it first aired. There have always been
movements opposing those innovations. | don’t think Al is different, but we must
remember that all these innovations are man-made, and as humans we can create and
innovate. As a musician, | think we should open our eyes, ears, and arms to work with
the new knowledge and innovation that Al can bring.

‘Al is acting like a sort of collective
unconscious.’

Often, when I speak to my contemporaries in the animation world, they prefer not to
think much about Al. But of course, we need to.

Generally speaking, Al does threaten jobs in the animation industry. I’m told that it is
already being used in some large studios. But it will also be a collaborator.

| am told by a knowledgeable friend that it would be possible to train Al on my style and
have it work as an assistant in my work. | can see how this would be useful, but, as |
actually like the repetitiveness of the animation process, the idea is not very appealing,
at least for my own personal work. But it might be a tempting idea in commercial jobs,
though | have not explored it yet. In my personal work, the repetition of hand drawing (I
draw on a digital tablet) gives me access to a less conscious, intentional side of the
creative process, which | think makes the work richer and more nuanced.

Although it is maybe far-fetched to talk about Al as creative or imaginative, the melding
of images from different sources, with large elements of the random, closely
approximates some aspects of the creative process. Al is acting like a sort of collective
unconscious, and | do find some of what it produces very interesting. | don’t suppose
that animated films made entirely by Al would be very successful, but used with human
guidance throughout the process, they could probably work very well.

| recently attended the Annecy Festival, and many people | spoke to there talked about

“riding the shark” — harnessing the power of Al while staying in control. People also
predicted the audience’s fatigue with the look of Al. It was noticeable that a high
proportion of films shown at this year’s festival were made using recognizably analog
techniques — stop-motion, animated painting, etc. — and this seems like a reaction
against the dominance of computer-generated imagery in the last years. We do seem to
want to see evidence of the human hand. Of course, Al may soon be able to simulate
that absolutely seamlessly!

A programmer | spoke to was of the opinion that the panic over the power of Al is hype-
manufactured by its makers to disguise its limitations and make it seem sexier. This
person saw it going the same way as VR, seeming to offer unlimited potential, but then
fizzling out. | would like to think that he’s right, but | can’t quite believe it.

To the question of whether Al can be a threat or collaborator, | might respond that every
new technology upends conventions and delivers not only new possibilities but a new
kind of material intelligence. | am sure many artists will be intrigued by the “agency” of
Al and seek ways to grapple or collaborate with it. Many already are. And we should be
grateful to be challenged and knocked out of our habits and assumptions! Most of the
things that worry me about this fall into the realm of the social and ethical. | hope there
are great artists to help us imagine around and work with this new reality.

As to whether it could be creative or comparable, | end up in circular thinking. Art means
what we ascribe to it. It can be a provocation, but it is essentially always part of a
conversation. Many artists are already using the inventions (and provocations) of Al in
works of great substance, but of course the artists are still the ones bringing it into the
room. If things change, maybe that will change too.

I've been following Al since the 1970s, when Marvin Minsky [one of the pioneers of
artificial intelligence] and | spent time together. But Al has emerged as the product of an
extraordinary computation capacity; algorithm, which is quite different from what Minsky
had imagined when he started working on it. For him, Al was the science of making
machines be as intelligent as humans, with the capacity for human reasoning.

Right now, it seems to me that Al has an extraordinary capacity to analyze, but | don’t
see it yet doing the kinds of things we, architects, do in our head when we design, which
involves taking into account a very large number of variables and sorting them out. And
yet, as an architect, | think Al can change our lives. If we ask the right questions, Al is
going to give us significant answers. For example, | can ask Al, “I have this building that’s
sitting on this particular site, and I'd like to optimize the sun, the shadow pattern, and I'd
like to position the windows at the place of optimal orientation,” and | think Al could give
us a helpful response. We could perfect our designs or improve them based on the
response. But | don’t think it’s going to give us the whole answer. For example, if you ask
Al to make a garden with hideaways, clearings, and planting arrangements for all the
seasons, | think it'll do that very well. But if you want to have a garden arranged in a way
that is magical and pleases you, I’m not sure it can do that.

I’m not frightened of Al at all. I’m intrigued. | think Al will be able to create graphic
presentations of extraordinary beauty and interest, but that leads us to the question of
what is art. Art has an element that is spiritual, emotional. It is something that happens
when you look at Picasso's “Guernica” and makes you think of the cruelty of humans to
humans, or when you look at a Monet piece, and you feel the unity with nature. In terms
of art created by Al, | don’t think we can call it art. | don’t see Al yet doing the kind of
creative things we do. | can see that it composes a piece of music, but | don’t think it
could create Beethoven's last sonatas on its own. Al can imitate something that’s
already been created and regurgitate it in another format, but that is not an original
work.

When our firm designed the Jewel Changi Airport in Singapore, our idea was to have
retail shops, airport facilities, and an attraction. The idea that this attraction should be a
magical garden came from me. | wonder if Al could have come up with the same idea. |
don't think so, but who knows? That would be a very interesting test.

| don’t know if Minsky’s dream of artificial intelligence is attainable because it assumed
that Al attains consciousness and independence of thoughts. Therefore, in some ways,
artificial intelligence is a misnomer. Maybe I’m underestimating its capacity, but from
where | stand as an amateur, because I’m an architect, not a mathematician, it seems to
me that intelligence assumes a certain independence and consciousness, which | don’t
think Al has right now.
