Since launching an initiative in early 2023, the Copyright Office has been examining the copyright law and policy issues raised by artificial
intelligence (Al), including the scope of copyright in Al-generated works and the use of copyrighted materials in Al training. After hosting
public listening sessions and webinars, the Office published a notice of inquiry in the Federal Register in August 2023, which received over
10,000 comments by December 2023.

The Office is issuing a Report in several Parts analyzing the issues, which will be published as they are completed and linked below.

© Report on Copyright and Artificial Intelligence

Copyright and Artificial Intelligence analyzes copyright law and policy issues raised by
artificial intelligence (Al). This Report is being issued in several Parts. Part 1 was
published on July 31, 2024, and addresses the topic of digital replicas. Part 2 was
published on January 29, 2025, and addresses the copyrightability of outputs created
using generative Al. On May 9, 2025, the Office released a pre-publication version of
Part 3 in response to congressional inquiries and expressions of interest from
stakeholders. A final version of Part 3 will be published in the future, without any
substantive changes expected in the analysis or conclusions.
