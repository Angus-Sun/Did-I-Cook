Torus

In geometry, a torus (pl,: tori or toruses) is a surface of
revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-
dimensional space one full revolution about an axis that is
coplanar with the circle. The main types of toruses include
ring toruses, horn toruses, and spindle toruses. A ring torus is
sometimes colloquially referred to as a donut or doughnut.

If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface
has a ring shape and is called a torus of revolution, also
known as a ring torus. If the axis of revolution is tangent to
the circle, the surface is a horn torus. If the axis of
revolution passes twice through the circle, the surface is a
spindle torus (or self-crossing torus or self-intersecting
torus). If the axis of revolution passes through the center of the
circle, the surface is a degenerate torus, a double-covered
sphere. If the revolved curve is not a circle, the surface is called
a toroid, as in a square toroid.

In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian

product of two circles: S 1x gl , which is sometimes used as the definition. It is a compact 2-manifold
of genus 1. The ring torus is one way to embed this space into Euclidean space, but another way to do
this is the Cartesian product of the embedding of S' | in the plane with itself. This produces a geometric
object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.

In the field of topology, a torus is any topological space that is homeomorphic to a torus.!! The
surface of a coffee cup and a doughnut are both topological tori with genus one.

An example of a torus can be constructed by taking a rectangular strip of flexible material such as
rubber, and joining the top edge to the bottom edge, and the left edge to the right edge, without any
half-twists (compare Klein bottle).

Etymology

Torus is a Latin word denoting something round, a swelling,
an elevation, a protuberance.

Geometry

A torus of revolution in 3-space can be parametrized as:[2!

2(9,¢) = (R+rsin 6) cos p
y(9, y) = (R+rsin 8) sin p

rotation around the tube and rotation around the torus's axis

distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus
and the minor radius r is the radius of the tube.!3! Aring torus with aspect ratio 3, the ratio

An implicit equation in Cartesian coordinates for a torus
radially symmetric about the z-axis is

Algebraically eliminating the square root gives a quartic equation,
(P+y+274+R- ry? =4R? (2? +y’).
The three classes of standard tori correspond to the three possible aspect ratios between R andr:

« When R >, the surface will be the familiar ring torus or anchor ring.
» R=r corresponds to the horn torus, which in effect is a torus with no "hole".

«» R<vr describes the self-intersecting spindle torus; its inner shell is a /emon and its outer shell is
an apple.

» When R = 0, the torus degenerates to the sphere radius r.
« When r = 0, the torus degenerates to the circle radius R.

When R = 1, the interior

These formulae are the same as for a cylinder of length 27R and

As a torus is the product of two circles, a modified version of the spherical coordinate system is
sometimes used. In traditional spherical coordinates there are three measures, R, the distance from
the center of the coordinate system, and 6 and g, angles measured from the center point.

As a torus has, effectively, two center points, the centerpoints of the angles are moved; g measures the
same angle as it does in the spherical system, but is known as the "toroidal" direction. The center
point of @ is moved to the center of r, and is known as the "poloidal" direction. These terms were first

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus 3/15

19/01/2026, 01:44 Torus - Wikipedia
used in a discussion of the Earth's magnetic field, where
"poloidal" was used to denote "the direction toward the
poles" [5]

In modern use, toroidal and poloidal are more commonly
used to discuss magnetic confinement fusion devices.

Topology

Poloidal direction (red arrow) and toroidal

Topologically, a torus is a closed surface defined as the
direction (blue arrow)

product of two circles: S ' x |. This can be viewed as lying in
C? and is a subset of the 3-sphere S? of radius V2. This
topological torus is also often called the Clifford torus./© In fact, S? is filled out by a family of nested
tori in this manner (with two degenerate circles), a fact that is important in the study of S? as a fiber
bundle over S? (the Hopf bundle).

The surface described above, given the relative topology from R’, is homeomorphic to a topological
torus as long as it does not intersect its own axis. A particular homeomorphism is given by
stereographically projecting the topological torus into R? from the north pole of S?.

The torus can also be described as a quotient of the Cartesian plane under the identifications
(x,y) ~ (@+1,y) ~ (2, y+ 1),

or, equivalently, as the quotient of the unit square by pasting the opposite edges together, described as
a fundamental polygon ABA |B",

The fundamental group of the torus is just the direct product of the
fundamental group of the circle with itself:

m(T?) = m1 (S1) x m(S1) &Z x 2.4

Intuitively speaking, this means that a closed path that circles the torus's

"hole" (say, a circle that traces out a particular latitude) and then circles

the torus's "body" (say, a circle that traces out a particular longitude) can

be deformed to a path that circles the body and then the hole. So, strictly

‘latitudinal’ and strictly ‘longitudinal’ paths commute. An equivalent — Turning a punctured torus
statement may be imagined as two shoelaces passing through each other, __ inside-out

then unwinding, then rewinding.

The fundamental group can also be derived from taking the torus as the quotient T? = R? / Z? (see
below), so that R? may be taken as its universal cover, with deck transformation group LP=nm (T’).

Its higher homotopy groups are all trivial, since a universal cover projection p: X 3X always
induces isomorphisms between the groups 7, (X ) and 1,(X) for n > 1, and R? is contractible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus 4/15

19/01/2026, 01:44 Torus - Wikipedia

The torus has homology groups:

Z, n=0,2
H,(T?)=< Z@Z, n=1
0 else.

Thus, the first homology group of the torus is isomorphic to its fundamental group-- which in
particular can be deduced from Hurewicz theorem since 7 (T”) is abelian.

The cohomology groups with integer coefficients are isomorphic to the homology ones-- which can be
seen either by direct computation, the universal coefficient theorem or even Poincaré duality.

If a torus is punctured and turned inside out then another torus results, with lines of latitude and
longitude interchanged. This is equivalent to building a torus from a cylinder, by joining the circular
ends together, in two ways: around the outside like joining two ends of a garden hose, or through the
inside like rolling a sock (with the toe cut off). Additionally, if the cylinder was made by gluing two
opposite sides of a rectangle together, choosing the other two sides instead will cause the same
reversal of orientation.

Two-sheeted cover

The 2-torus is a twofold branched cover of the 2-sphere, with four ramification points. Every
conformal structure on the 2-torus can be represented as such a two-sheeted cover of the 2-sphere.
The points on the torus corresponding to the ramification points are the Weierstrass points. In fact,
the conformal type of the torus is determined by the cross-ratio of the four points.

n-dimensional torus

The torus has a generalization to higher dimensions, the n-
dimensional torus, often called the n-torus or hypertorus for
short. (This is the more typical meaning of the term "/-torus",
the other referring to holes or of genus 7.81) Just as the
ordinary torus is topologically the product space of two
circles, the n-dimensional torus is topologically equivalent to
the product of 7 circles. That is:

R” modulo the action of the integer lattice Z” (with the action being taken as vector addition).
Equivalently, the n-torus is obtained from the n-dimensional hypercube by gluing the opposite faces
together.

An n-torus in this sense is an example of an n-dimensional compact manifold. It is also an example of
a compact abelian Lie group. This follows from the fact that the unit circle is a compact abelian Lie
group (when identified with the unit complex numbers with multiplication). Group multiplication on
the torus is then defined by coordinate-wise multiplication.

Toroidal groups play an important part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This is due in part to the
fact that in any compact Lie group G one can always find a maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup
which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori 7 have a controlling role to play
in theory of connected G. Toroidal groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact
connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds.

Automorphisms of 7 are easily constructed from automorphisms of the lattice Z.”, which are classified
by invertible integral matrices of size n with an integral inverse; these are just the integral matrices

with determinant +1. Making them act on R” in the usual way, one has the typical toral
automorphism on the quotient.

The fundamental group of an n-torus is a free abelian group of rank n. The Ath homology group of an
n-torus is a free abelian group of rank n choose k. It follows that the Euler characteristic of the n-torus
is 0 for all n. The cohomology ring H*(T, Z) can be identified with the exterior algebra over the Z-
module Z” whose generators are the duals of the n nontrivial cycles.

and collaborators (Felipe Posada, Michael Kolinas, et al.), being used to model musical triads.!9/20]

Flat torus

A flat torus is a torus with the metric inherited from its
representation as the quotient, R? / L, where L is a discrete
subgroup of R? isomorphic to Z. This gives the quotient the
structure of a Riemannian manifold, as well as the structure of
an abelian Lie group. Perhaps the simplest example of this is
when L = Z: R? / ZL, which can also be described as the
Cartesian plane under the identifications
(x, vy) ~ (x + 1, y) ~ (x, y + 1). This particular flat torus (and
any uniformly scaled version of it) is known as the "square"
flat torus. In three dimensions, one can bend a
rectangle into a torus, but doing this

curvature everywhere. It is flat in the same sense that the
surface of a cylinder is flat. In 3 dimensions, one can bend a flat sheet of
paper into a cylinder without stretching the paper, but this cylinder cannot
be bent into a torus without stretching the paper (unless some regularity
and differentiability conditions are given up, see below).

A simple 4-dimensional Euclidean embedding of a rectangular flat torus
(more general than the square one) is as follows:

Other tori in S° having this partitioning property include the square tori of the form Q - 7, where Q is
a rotation of 4-dimensional space R*+, or in other words Q is amember of the Lie group SO(4).

It is known that there exists no C2 (twice continuously differentiable) embedding of a flat torus into 3-
space. (The idea of the proof is to take a large sphere containing such a flat torus in its interior, and
shrink the radius of the sphere until it just touches the torus for the first time. Such a point of contact
must be a tangency. But that would imply that part of the torus, since it has zero curvature
everywhere, must lie strictly outside the sphere, which is a contradiction.) On the other hand,
according to the Nash-Kuiper theorem, which was proven in the 1950s, an isometric C' embedding
exists. This is solely an existence proof and does not provide explicit equations for such an embedding.

Conformal classification of flat tori

In the study of Riemann surfaces, one says that any two smooth compact geometric surfaces are
"conformally equivalent" when there exists a smooth homeomorphism between them that is both
angle-preserving and orientation-preserving. The Uniformization theorem guarantees that every
Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one that has constant Gaussian curvature. In the case of
a torus, the constant curvature must be zero. Then one defines the "moduli space" of the torus to
contain one point for each conformal equivalence class, with the appropriate topology. It turns out
that this moduli space M may be identified with a punctured sphere that is smooth except for two
points that have less angle than 2x (radians) around them: One has total angle m and the other has
total angle 27/3.

M may be turned into a compact space M* — topologically equivalent to a sphere — by adding one
additional point that represents the limiting case as a rectangular torus approaches an aspect ratio of
o in the limit. The result is that this compactified moduli space is a sphere with three points each
having less than 2x total angle around them. (Such a point is termed a "cusp", and may be thought of
as the vertex of a cone, also called a "conepoint".) This third conepoint will have zero total angle
around it. Due to symmetry, M* may be constructed by glueing together two congruent geodesic
triangles in the hyperbolic plane along their (identical) boundaries, where each triangle has angles of
m/2, m/3, and 0. (The three angles of a hyperbolic triangle T determine T up to congruence.) As a
result, the Gauss—Bonnet theorem shows that the area of each triangle can be calculated as
mn — (1/2 + 2/3 + 0) = 21/6, so it follows that the compactified moduli space M* has area equal to 77/3.

The other two cusps occur at the points corresponding in M* to (a) the square torus (total angle 7)
and (b) the hexagonal torus (total angle 27/3). These are the only conformal equivalence classes of flat
tori that have any conformal automorphisms other than those generated by translations and negation.

Genus g surface

In the theory of surfaces there is a more general family of objects, the "genus" g surfaces. A genus g
surface is the connected sum of g two-tori. (And so the torus itself is the surface of genus 1.) To form a
connected sum of two surfaces, remove from each the interior of a disk and "glue" the surfaces
together along the boundary circles. (That is, merge the two boundary circles so they become just one
circle.) To form the connected sum of more than two surfaces, successively take the connected sum of
two of them at a time until they are all connected. In this sense, a genus g surface resembles the
surface of g doughnuts stuck together side by side, or a 2-sphere with g handles attached.

As examples, a genus zero surface (without boundary) is the two-sphere while a genus one surface
(without boundary) is the ordinary torus. The surfaces of higher genus are sometimes called n-holed
tori (or, rarely, n-fold tori). The terms double torus and triple torus are also occasionally used.

The classification theorem for surfaces states that every compact connected surface is topologically
equivalent to either the sphere or the connect sum of some number of tori, disks, and real projective
planes.

Toroidal polyhedra

Polyhedra with the topological type of a torus are called
toroidal polyhedra, and have Euler _ characteristic
V — E + F = 0. For any number of holes, the formula
generalizes to V- E + F = 2 — 2g, where g is the topological
genus.

Toroidal polyhedra have been used to show that the maximum

number of colors to color a map on a torus is seven. The

Szilassi polyhedron is one example of a toroidal polyhedron

with this property.!6] A toroidal polyhedron with 6 x 4 = 24
quadrilateral faces

The Szilassi polyhedron's dual, the Csdszar polyhedron, is the
only polyhedron other than the tetrahedron which has the
property that every possible edge connecting two vertices is an edge of the polyhedron.171

The term "toroidal polyhedron" is also used for higher-genus polyhedra and for immersions of
toroidal polyhedra, although some authors only include those with genus 1.81

Self-crossing toroidal polyhedra are determined by the topology of their abstract manifold. One subset
of the self-crossing toroidal polyhedra are the crown polyhedra, which are the only toroidal polyhedra
that are also noble.

Automorphisms

The homeomorphism group (or the subgroup of diffeomorphisms) of the torus is studied in geometric
topology. Its mapping class group (the connected components of the homeomorphism group) is
surjective onto the group GL(n, Z) of invertible integer matrices, which can be realized as linear
maps on the universal covering space R” that preserve the standard lattice Z” (this corresponds to
integer coefficients) and thus descend to the quotient.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus 10/15

19/01/2026, 01:44 Torus - Wikipedia
At the level of homotopy and homology, the mapping class group can be identified as the action on the
first homology (or equivalently, first cohomology, or on the fundamental group, as these are all
naturally isomorphic; also the first cohomology group generates the cohomology algebra:

MCGx(T") = Aut(m(X)) = Aut(Z") = GL(n, Z).

Since the torus is an Eilenberg—MacLane space K(G, 1), its homotopy equivalences, up to homotopy,
can be identified with automorphisms of the fundamental group); all homotopy equivalences of the
torus can be realized by homeomorphisms — every homotopy equivalence is homotopic to a
homeomorphism.

Thus the short exact sequence of the mapping class group splits (an identification of the torus as the
quotient of R” gives a splitting, via the linear maps, as above):

1 — Homeo)(T”) + Homeo(T”) + MCGrop(T”) > 1.

The mapping class group of higher genus surfaces is much more complicated, and an area of active
research.

Coloring a torus

The torus's Heawood number is seven, meaning every graph that can be embedded on the torus has a
chromatic number of at most seven. (Since the complete graph K7 can be embedded on the torus, and
x(K7) = 7, the upper bound is tight.) Equivalently, in a torus divided into regions, it is always
possible to color the regions using no more than seven colors so that no neighboring regions are the
same color. (Contrast with the four color theorem for the plane.)

This construction shows the torus divided into seven regions, every one of which
touches every other, meaning each must be assigned a unique color.

de Bruijn torus

In combinatorial mathematics, a de Bruijn torus is an array of symbols from an alphabet (often just 0
and 1) that contains every m-by-n matrix exactly once. It is a torus because the edges are considered
wraparound for the purpose of finding matrices. Its name comes from the De Bruijn sequence, which
can be considered a special case where 77 is 1 (one dimension).
