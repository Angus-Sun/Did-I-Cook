Homeomorphism

In mathematics and more specifically in topology, a homeomorphism (from Greek roots meaning
"similar shape", named by Henri Poincaré), I[2] also called topological isomorphism, or
bicontinuous function, is a bijective and continuous function between topological spaces that has a
continuous inverse function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological
spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space.
Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a
topological viewpoint they are the same.

Very roughly speaking, a topological space is a geometric object, and a homeomorphism results from a
continuous deformation of the object into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic
to each other, but a sphere and a torus are not. However, this description can be misleading. Some
continuous deformations do not produce homeomorphisms, such as the deformation of a line into a
point. Some homeomorphisms do not result from continuous deformations, such as the
homeomorphism between a trefoil knot and a circle. Homotopy and isotopy are precise definitions for
the informal concept of continuous deformation.

Definition

A function f : X — Y between two topological spaces is a homeomorphism if it has the following
properties:

« f is a bijection (one-to-one and onto),

« f is continuous,

= the inverse function fl is continuous (f is an open mapping).
A homeomorphism is sometimes called a bicontinuous function. If such a function exists, X and Y
are homeomorphic. A self-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism from a topological space onto
itself. Being "homeomorphic" is an equivalence relation on topological spaces. Its equivalence classes
are called homeomorphism classes.

The third requirement, that ful be continuous, is essential. Consider for instance the function
f : (0,27) — S* (the unit circle in R?) defined byf(v) = (cos y, sing). This function is bijective
and continuous, but not a homeomorphism ($1 is compact but [0, 277) is not). The function f~! is not
continuous at the point (1,0), because although f~! maps (1,0) to 0, any neighbourhood of this
point also includes points that the function maps close to 27, but the points it maps to numbers in
between lie outside the neighbourhood.!3!

Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces. As such, the
composition of two homeomorphisms is again a homeomorphism, and the set of all self-

homeomorphisms X — X forms a group, called the homeomorphism group of X, often denoted

Homeo(X). This group can be given a topology, such as the compact-open topology, which under

certain assumptions makes it a topological group.(41

In some contexts, there are homeomorphic objects that cannot be continuously deformed from one to
the other. Homotopy and isotopy are equivalence relations that have been introduced for dealing with

such situations.

Similarly, as usual in category theory, given two spaces that are homeomorphic, the space of
homeomorphisms between them, Homeo(X,Y), is a torsor for the homeomorphism groups
Homeo(X) and Homeo(Y), and, given a specific homeomorphism between X and Y, all three sets

are identified.

Examples

« The open interval (a, b) is homeomorphic to the real
numbers R for any a < b. (In this case, a
bicontinuous forward mapping is given by
f(z) = — + = while other such mappings are

given by scaled and translated versions of the tan or
arg tanh functions).

= The unit 2-disc D? and the unit square in R? are
homeomorphic; since the unit disc can be deformed
into the unit square. An example of a bicontinuous
mapping from the square to the disc is, in polar
coordinates,

(0,8) > (sano) )

= The graph of a differentiable function is
homeomorphic to the domain of the function.

= Adifferentiable parametrization of a curve is a
homeomorphism between the domain of the
parametrization and the curve.

= Achart of a manifold is a homeomorphism between
an open subset of the manifold and an open subset
of a Euclidean space.

A thickened trefoil knot is homeomorphic to a
solid torus, but not isotopic in R?®. Continuous
mappings are not always realizable as
deformations.

= The stereographic projection is a homeomorphism between the unit sphere in R? with a single
point removed and the set of all points in R? (a 2-dimensional plane).

« If Gis a topological group, its inversion map x +> x~
the left translation y +> zy, the right translation y +> ya, and the inner automorphism y +> xyz!

are homeomorphisms.

= The Euclidean real line is not homeomorphic to the unit circle as a subspace of R?, since the unit
circle is compact as a subspace of Euclidean R? but the real line is not compact.

» The one-dimensional intervals [0, 1] and (0, 1) are not homeomorphic because one is compact
while the other is not.

Properties

=» Two homeomorphic spaces share the same topological properties. For example, if one of them is
compact, then the other is as well; if one of them is connected, then the other is as well; if one of
them is Hausdorff, then the other is as well; their homotopy and homology groups will coincide.
Note however that this does not extend to properties defined via a metric; there are metric spaces
that are homeomorphic even though one of them is complete and the other is not.

=» Ahomeomorphism is simultaneously an open mapping and a closed mapping; that is, it maps
open sets to open sets and closed sets to closed sets.

= Every self-homeomorphism in S* can be extended to a self-homeomorphism of the whole disk D
(Alexander's trick).

Informal discussion

The intuitive criterion of stretching, bending, cutting and gluing back together takes a certain amount
of practice to apply correctly—it may not be obvious from the description above that deforming a line
segment to a point is impermissible, for instance. It is thus important to realize that it is the formal
definition given above that counts. In this case, for example, the line segment possesses infinitely
many points, and therefore cannot be put into a bijection with a set containing only a finite number of
points, including a single point.

This characterization of a homeomorphism often leads to a confusion with the concept of homotopy,
which is actually defined as a continuous deformation, but from one function to another, rather than
one space to another. In the case of a homeomorphism, envisioning a continuous deformation is a
mental tool for keeping track of which points on space X correspond to which points on Y—one just
follows them as X deforms. In the case of homotopy, the continuous deformation from one map to the
other is of the essence, and it is also less restrictive, since none of the maps involved need to be one-
to-one or onto. Homotopy does lead to a relation on spaces: homotopy equivalence.

There is a name for the kind of deformation involved in visualizing a homeomorphism. It is (except
when cutting and regluing are required) an isotopy between the identity map on X and the
homeomorphism from X to Y.
